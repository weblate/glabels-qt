## What is gLabels-qt?

gLabels-qt is the development version of the next major version of gLabels (a.k.a. glabels-4).


## What's new in gLabels 4?

- A complete rewrite, based on the Qt6 framework.
- A new UI layout based on common activities.
- Cross-platform support
- User-defined variables
- Support for continuous-roll labels
- Many new product templates


## Download

### Latest Release

There are currently no official releases of gLabels 4.

### Continuous Integration Snapshots

Currently there are no self-hosted binary snapshot releases available.  I plan to make these available again once 4.0 is more imminent.  In the mean time, I encourage you to try building the code yourself.

Some third-party packages may also be available:
